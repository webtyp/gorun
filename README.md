# gorun
<img src="docs/img/badges.svg">

gorun is a Go package that provides a simple interface to run, monitor, and stop external programs, capturing their output and handling graceful shutdowns.

## Usage

### Installation

# gorun

Small helper to run/monitor/stop external programs from Go.

Usage (essential)

Install:

```sh
go get webtyp.com/gorun
```

Minimal example (use `WorkingDir` when child needs a specific CWD):

```go
cfg := &gorun.Config{
    ExecProgramPath: "./my-server",
    WorkingDir:      "/abs/path/to/project/pwa", // optional
    ExitChan:        make(chan bool),
}
r := gorun.New(cfg)
_ = r.RunProgram()
// ... stop when needed
_ = r.StopProgram()

// Or stop any running app by name (cross-platform)
_ = gorun.StopApp("my-server")
// By default gorun captures output internally. For programmatic access in
// tests prefer not to rely on exported getters; pass a `Logger` (io.Writer)
// to receive forwarded output, or inspect the internal buffer from tests.
```

Notes
- `WorkingDir`: optional; if empty child inherits parent's CWD. Prefer absolute paths.
- `Logger`: optional io.Writer. gorun captures output internally; use `GetOutput()` in tests or when you need programmatic access.

Tests

```bash
cd gorun
go test ./... -v
go test ./... -race -v  # run with race detector
```

That's it — small, focused, non-redundant docs. If you want, I can add one short `goserver` example showing how to set `WorkingDir` from an `AutoConfig`.

These tests exercise WorkingDir handling and cleanup behaviors.
